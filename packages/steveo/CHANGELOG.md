## 7.0.3

### Patch Changes

- ae7afe2: There is an issue (more like an easter egg) preventing Kafka message from being
  produced when DatadogMiddleware is activated.

  The issue happens basically because DatadogMiddleware expects payload to be a
  dictionary so it can inject the Datadog traces in the message. However, Kafka is
  sending the `Message.value` attribute, which is a string causing the following error.

  `Cannot create property '_meta' on string '*' `

  The fix consists of changing DatadogMiddleware::publish to not add the datadog
  context attribute to the message whenever `MiddlewareContext.payload` is of type
  string.

- fb35c2c: Fix configuration bug after AWS SQS upgrade.
  The issue occurred due to inconsistencies in local and non-local environments,
  because locally the AWS credentials env variables are required an env vars while
  in non-local we use the instance role, therefore the credentials are not required.

  The fix consists of a new attribute credentials in the config, set during local
  development only, which wrapper the AWS credentials.

## 7.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 4e0e627: Fix bug in `Steveo::task` factory that was registering topics with a wrong name
  as a result of a bug in the `formatTopicName`. This was causing SQS queue not
  being created correctly and failures in the healthcheck.

- f1392ba: Upgrade AWS SDK major version to 3.\*

  Even though, there was no breaking change in Steveo the AWS SDK upgrade some core features that may cause unexpected

  cannot still happen.

  There were no changes in how Steveo should be used.
