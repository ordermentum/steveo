A Task Pub/Sub Background processing library (Task Framework for Node.js)

Steveo is a task management library that supports Kafka, SQS and Redis.

Think of it as [sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) for node.js with support for multiple backends.

On a highlevel, it works as below, Steveo has 3 main components

```
              +-----------+     +-----------+     +-----------+
              |           |     |           |     |           |
PUBLISH ----->|   TASK    |     | REGISTRY  |     |   RUNNER  |-----> RECEIVE
              |           |     |           |     |           |
              |           |     |           |     |           |
              +-----------+     +-----------+     +-----------+
```

### Task

Holds the information about the type of task. It has below methods,

- publish - send a message onto a queue
- subscribe - process a message

### Registry

Responsible for keeping the inventory of tasks & event manager. Whenever a new task is created, an entry will be added in the registry

### Runner

Responsible for consuming messages,

- `process` method initialize group consumers and start to consume the messages. It will then call the subscribe callback set on the task

Emitting events based on success/failures

- runner_receive -> Received a message
- runner_complete -> Completed running the associated task
- runner_failure -> Failed running the associated task
- runner_connection_failure -> Error while polling for message (Kafka only)

- task_send
- task_success
- task_failure
- task_added
- task_removed

- producer_success
- producer_failure

### Example

```javascript
(async () => {
  const steveo = Steveo({
    kafkaConnection: process.env.KAFKA_CONNECTION,
    clientId: '1234-123',
  });

  const example = steveo.task('example-task', async ({ name }) => {
    console.log(`hello ${name}`);
  });

  await example.publish({ name: 'tommo' });
  await example.publish({ name: 'bazza' });

  await steveo.runner().process();
})();
```

Publish without registering a task

```javascript
await steveo.publish('example-task', { name: 'Apple' });
```
